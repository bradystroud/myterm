MyTerm is an opinionated native macOS terminal for people who keep several projects open all day. It puts long-lived terminal sessions and WebKit browser tabs inside named workspaces, with fast pane splitting and very little surrounding UI.

It is not a terminal framework, an agent dashboard, a cross-platform Electron app, or a browser with a terminal bolted on. The first release deliberately focuses on the small part of cmux that its author uses every day.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later
- Apple silicon for the current downloadable release
- Xcode's Swift toolchain when building from source

## Install

Homebrew is the primary installation path:

```bash
brew install --cask gordonbeeming/tap/myterm
open -a myterm
```

The cask installs the signed, notarized, and stapled Apple silicon release. MyTerm quits when its last window closes; launching it again restores the saved workspace layout.

When MyTerm upgrades legacy workspace state, it keeps the original file in an adjacent v1 backup before writing the migrated layout. If recovery has to discard a malformed element, it likewise preserves the original bytes in an adjacent recovery backup before committing the repaired state.

## The workflow

- **Workspaces** have a title, can be pinned and reordered, and live inside collapsible color-coded folders. Drag one onto a folder to file it there, or onto another workspace to reorder it inside the folder it already lives in.
- **Pane groups** own their own terminal and browser tabs. Every group keeps an independent selected tab, and browser tabs keep their URL, cookies, and website data across app restarts.
- **Panes** split right with <kbd>⌘D</kbd> and down with <kbd>⇧⌘D</kbd>. Their dividers can be dragged, and the saved proportions restore on the next launch.
- **One app instance** handles launch requests. Opening a folder, script, SSH link, or web URL reuses the existing window instead of creating another app process.
- **Compact native UI** keeps workspace and tab chrome out of the way. There is no agent-status layer or ornamental terminal dashboard.

### Bringing workspaces in from elsewhere

**Workspace → Import Workspaces…** adds workspaces from a JSON document, so a set of projects can be
described in a file — or generated from another terminal's saved session — instead of being rebuilt
by hand. The import only ever appends, and folders are matched by title so a repeat import does not
duplicate them. See [docs/WORKSPACE_IMPORT.md](docs/WORKSPACE_IMPORT.md) for the format.
### Staying current

**myterm → Check for Updates…** compares this build against the newest published release, and the app
checks once a day on its own. A waiting update shows as a quiet badge at the bottom of the sidebar —
nothing appears while you are current, and nothing is ever downloaded or installed for you.

Updating is handled by whatever installed the app. A Homebrew copy runs
`brew upgrade --cask gordonbeeming/tap/myterm` in a new tab, so the upgrade happens in front of you
rather than behind a progress bar; quit and reopen myterm once it finishes. Any other copy is sent to
the release page. The automatic check can be turned off under **Updates** in Global Settings.

### Terminal links stay with the work

Command-click any valid HTTP or HTTPS link in a terminal and MyTerm opens it as a browser pane beside that exact terminal. This works for localhost and remote sites alike.

Tabs can be dragged to reorder within a pane group, dropped into another group, or dropped on a pane edge to make a new group. Moving the final tab out closes the now-empty pane.

Every terminal process also receives a `BROWSER` launcher and a narrow `open` shim inside the app bundle. Tools such as Codex, Claude, Plannotator, and `ide browse` send their HTTP and HTTPS links back beside the originating pane, even if another workspace has since become active. MyTerm does not become the macOS default browser.

The link arrives without pulling MyTerm to the front, so an agent working in a workspace you are not watching cannot interrupt you.

Reaching the shim takes more than `PATH`. Your own shell startup files run after MyTerm sets `PATH` and normally push the bundle behind `/usr/bin`, which would send every `open` to your default browser instead. So the app also loads a startup file of its own: `BASH_ENV` for bash, and a `ZDOTDIR` chain for zsh. Each one defines an `open` function, and a function is found before anything on `PATH`. The zsh chain runs your `.zshenv`, `.zprofile`, `.zshrc`, and `.zlogin` in their usual order and leaves `MYTERM_ORIGINAL_ZDOTDIR` holding your real `ZDOTDIR`. Panes that are already open keep the environment they started with, so restart a pane after updating the app.

A tool that explicitly invokes `/usr/bin/open` bypasses MyTerm and can still open externally. Non-web `open` requests retain their normal system handling. Terminal links to configured text files use the scoped **Open text files with** command in Browser Settings, which defaults to `ide browse {file}`. Use suffix patterns such as `*.json` for Markdown, JSON, source, and config files; literal names such as `README`, `Dockerfile`, and `.gitignore` match exactly. Unsupported files and failed or empty text-file commands open in their macOS application instead of MyTerm's browser.

### Reach your terminals from an iPad or iPhone

MyTerm Remote is a companion app in `apps/MyTermRemote`. Link a device once by scanning the code
under **Settings → Devices → Link a Device…**, and it lists the same workspaces, shows the same cook
beside tabs that need you, and opens any terminal tab as the live session on the Mac. Nothing runs
on the device: it is a window onto this Mac. The connection is TLS with a key derived from the
pairing token, and it reconnects on its own when the Mac or the device comes back. On the local
network the device finds the Mac by name or address. From anywhere else it goes through a relay
you host yourself, a small Cloudflare Worker in `relay/` that forwards encrypted bytes and can read
none of them. See [docs/REMOTE_COMPANION.md](docs/REMOTE_COMPANION.md) for the design and how to
try it.

### Know when an agent needs you

A tab whose agent is running shows a cook where its icon usually goes. He tells you what the agent
is doing without you having to read the terminal:

| The cook | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Stirring | The agent is working. |
| Blue | The agent finished its turn, and you have not seen it yet. |
| Purple | The agent asked a question, and it is still unanswered. |
| Gone | Nothing is happening. The tab goes back to its own icon. |

The workspace row in the sidebar carries the same cook, showing whichever of its tabs is most
urgent: a question, then a finish, then work in progress.

Reading a tab is what quietens it. Reaching the tab, switching to its workspace, or coming back to
MyTerm from another app all count. A question is the exception, because reading a question does not
answer it: the cook stays purple until you reply and the agent goes back to work.

The indicator is off until you press **Set Up Claude Code Hooks** or **Set Up Codex Hooks** in
General Settings. Each writes three hooks to that agent's own file, and the same button removes them
again:

| Agent | File | Working | Finished | Question |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `UserPromptSubmit` | `Stop` | `Notification` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/hooks.json` | `UserPromptSubmit` | `Stop` | `PermissionRequest` |

These files are shared with other tools. MyTerm marks its own commands with a trailing
`# myterm-managed-hook` comment, adds nothing else, and removes only what carries that mark.

Each hook writes an escape sequence to its own terminal, `ESC ]7337;agent=claude;event=finished;session=<id> ESC \`,
and does nothing unless `MYTERM_PANE_ID` is set. Only MyTerm's terminals set it, so the hooks stay
silent in every other terminal, and terminals that do not know the code ignore it. Restart the agent
session after installing the hooks.

Any agent can drive the cook by writing that sequence itself, with its own name in `agent=`. The
name is what the notification says, so a Codex report reads "Codex finished its turn."

The state is not saved. After a relaunch, no tab carries a cook until its agent reports again.

### Come back to a live agent

A pane that was in a Claude Code conversation rejoins that same conversation when MyTerm starts
again. The pane restores its working directory and its recent output as before, then runs
`claude --resume <id>`, so quitting is no longer the end of the work in progress.

The conversation identifier comes from the hooks above, so agent recovery needs them installed.
Nothing else about the agent is read: MyTerm keeps the identifier the agent reports, and only if it
is short and free of shell characters.

Codex panes are not resumed. Its hooks report a new identifier for every turn rather than the one
`codex resume` accepts, so a restored pane would open on an error instead of the conversation. Codex
hooks still drive the tab indicator above.

A pane left at its shell prompt when you quit comes back to a shell prompt. Leaving the agent is how
you tell MyTerm the work is finished.

Turn the whole behavior off with **Restore agent sessions** in General Settings. Like the other
terminal settings, it can be overridden for one folder or one workspace.

## Browser sessions and passkeys

New browser tabs can remember cookies and website data at one of four scopes, selected in Settings:

- **Across all workspaces** uses one profile for the active app channel.
- **Per MyTerm folder** shares a profile between every workspace in the same sidebar folder. Workspaces that aren't in a folder share one profile of their own.
- **Per workspace** isolates each workspace and is the default.
- **Per project directory** shares a profile for terminals rooted in the same Git repository or directory.

Existing tabs keep their assigned profile when this setting changes. MyTerm stores browser profile identifiers and WebKit stores the website data; MyTerm never stores passkeys.

WebAuthn requests are passed to macOS and the user's chosen credential provider, such as Apple Passwords or 1Password. Apple's managed browser passkey entitlement is intentionally absent until Apple approves it for the signing team, so local and current distribution builds report that capability as unavailable.

## Default terminal integration

In Settings, choose **Make MyTerm the Default** to register MyTerm for `.command` and `.tool` scripts, UNIX executables, and `ssh://` links. It does not register MyTerm as the default HTTP or HTTPS browser.

Folders open a terminal tab in that folder. Scripts and executables run from their containing folder. SSH URLs are parsed into a normal `ssh` command with user and port support.

## Development channels

Run the development channel from the repository:

```bash
./run.sh
```

This builds and launches `myterm-dev`. It has its own bundle identifier, browser settings, website-data profiles, and workspace state, so it can live beside production `myterm`.

```bash
./run.sh --prod
./run.sh --verify
swift test --parallel
```

`./run.sh` also supports `--bundle`, `--debug`, `--logs`, and `--telemetry`. The app uses SwiftTerm for native terminal rendering and WebKit for the built-in browser. Chromium is intentionally not bundled; [docs/BROWSER_ENGINES.md](docs/BROWSER_ENGINES.md) describes the boundary for a separately downloaded engine later.

## Release trust chain

The source commits for the release are SSH-signed. The GitHub release workflow then:

1. builds the arm64 application;
2. signs `myterm.app` with a Developer ID Application certificate, hardened runtime, and secure timestamp;
3. notarizes and staples the app;
4. creates the DMG, then signs, notarizes, staples, and validates the DMG separately; and
5. updates the Homebrew cask with an SSH-signed `myterm-release[bot]` commit.

The app and its disk image therefore each have their own validated distribution signature and notarization ticket. [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) documents the checks and required GitHub environment secrets.

## Current boundaries

- macOS only; downloadable builds are Apple silicon only.
- One main window and one built-in WebKit engine.
- Terminal and browser panes share the same persistent split layout.
- Chromium remains an optional future download so the main app stays small.
- Passkey pass-through requires Apple's managed entitlement before it can be enabled in distribution.

### Notifications when you are somewhere else

**Notify when an agent needs you**, in General Settings, posts a banner when an agent finishes or
asks a question. It only fires while MyTerm is not the app in front, because the cook has already
said it when the window is on screen.

The banner is named after the workspace, the tab, or both, whichever you pick, and it carries a
swatch of the workspace's folder colour, so a glance is enough to tell which project wants you.
A workspace outside a folder uses its own colour. Clicking the banner opens that tab.

### Send web links to Safari instead

MyTerm's own browser is the default destination for web links. To use a real browser, set **Open web links in** in Browser Settings to **Default browser** or to a specific application, such as Safari or Google Chrome. The picker lists the browsers installed on this Mac.

The setting follows the same three scopes as the other preferences, so one workspace can send its links to Safari while the rest keep using MyTerm.

It applies to command-clicked terminal links, to links from tools that use the `BROWSER` launcher or the `open` shim, and to web addresses handed to MyTerm. **New Browser Tab** always opens MyTerm's own browser, and links clicked inside an existing browser pane stay in MyTerm.

The browser you choose comes forward only for a link from the workspace you are looking at, while MyTerm is the active app. So a link you command-click in the pane in front of you still jumps straight to it, while one an agent opened somewhere else loads in the background and waits for you.

MyTerm never sends a link to itself. If the chosen browser is missing, or if MyTerm is the default browser, the link opens in MyTerm and the app reports why.

## Browser sessions and passkeys

New browser tabs can remember cookies and website data at one of four scopes, selected in Settings:

- **Across all workspaces** uses one profile for the active app channel.
- **Per MyTerm folder** shares a profile between every workspace in the same sidebar folder. Workspaces that aren't in a folder share one profile of their own.
- **Per workspace** isolates each workspace and is the default.
- **Per project directory** shares a profile for terminals rooted in the same Git repository or directory.

Existing tabs keep their assigned profile when this setting changes. MyTerm stores browser profile identifiers and WebKit stores the website data; MyTerm never stores passkeys.

WebAuthn requests are passed to macOS and the user's chosen credential provider, such as Apple Passwords or 1Password. Apple's managed browser passkey entitlement is intentionally absent until Apple approves it for the signing team, so local and current distribution builds report that capability as unavailable.
