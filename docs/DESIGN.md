# Design System: MyTerm

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Native Workbench"**

MyTerm should feel like a dependable part of macOS: dense, direct, and quiet enough to disappear while work is happening. The hierarchy comes from familiar system structure: a title-only source list, compact tab rows inside each pane group, and uninterrupted working surfaces. It does not need decoration.

The app stays deliberately narrow in scope. It should never resemble an agent dashboard, a novelty terminal, or a web app wrapped in desktop chrome.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Native system controls and behavior
- Compact, readable density
- Large uninterrupted terminal and browser surfaces
- Clear focus and keyboard paths
- No ornamental status or motion

## Colors

MyTerm uses macOS semantic colors and materials so contrast, selection, and appearance follow the active system theme. Terminal colors belong to the terminal profile and rendered content rather than the surrounding app chrome.

**The System Owns the Palette Rule.** Do not freeze native backgrounds, labels, separators, focus rings, or selection colors into custom hex values.

## Typography

**Display Font:** macOS system UI
**Body Font:** macOS system UI
**Label/Mono Font:** the terminal engine's monospaced terminal font

**Character:** Interface text is familiar and restrained. Monospaced type is reserved for terminal content; workspace titles, tabs, menus, and browser controls remain native system text.

### Hierarchy

- **Title:** Native navigation-title styling for the app and workspace rail.
- **Body:** Native control and field styling for workspace names and browser addresses.
- **Label:** Small native control sizing for tabs and compact actions.
- **Mono:** SwiftTerm's terminal typography, controlled by the terminal surface rather than SwiftUI chrome.

**The Terminal Owns Mono Rule.** Do not spread monospaced type into navigation or general controls to make the app look more technical.

## Elevation

MyTerm is flat by default. Depth comes from macOS window materials, source-list selection, dividers, splitters, and control states; the app adds no custom shadows.

**The Working Surface Rule.** Terminal and browser content should remain visually dominant, with chrome separated by structure rather than floating cards.

## Components

### Workspace Sidebar

- **Width:** 220–480 pt, ideally 280 pt.
- **Rows:** One title line only, using native source-list selection. Renaming is an explicit command or context-menu action.
- **Folders:** Native disclosure rows with one semantic folder color. Folders collapse and accept dragged workspaces.
- **Drag and drop:** A drag either files a workspace or reorders it, never both. Folder rows and the Unfiled header tint across their whole width and take the workspace at the bottom; a workspace row in the same folder draws an insertion line at the nearer edge instead, and rows in other folders refuse the drop. Folders reorder against each other the same way, and pinned rows never cross into the unpinned band.
- **Actions:** Compact plus and minus icons at the bottom, with tooltips and accessibility labels.

### Tab Strip

- **Height:** A 26 pt control row with 6 pt vertical and 8 pt horizontal padding.
- **Tabs:** Native small bordered controls, 112–160 pt wide, with a close control on the selected tab.
- **Ownership:** Every pane group has its own strip and selected tab. There is no workspace-wide strip.
- **Overflow:** Horizontal scrolling keeps the local selected tab visible. The add-tab menu stays fixed.
- **Drag and drop:** A tab can reorder inside its strip, move to another group, or create a group by dropping on an edge.

### Terminal Pane

- **Surface:** SwiftTerm fills the available pane without an inset card or decorative border.
- **Splits:** Native draggable splitters preserve child proportions. Each pane has one quiet overflow menu for split and close actions.
- **Focus:** The AppKit first responder decides the active terminal. Only that terminal shows a caret at full opacity and receives pane commands.

### Browser Pane

- **Toolbar:** Back, Forward, Refresh, then one rounded Address field in a compact horizontal row.
- **Surface:** WKWebView fills the remaining content area.
- **Behavior:** Browser and terminal panes can share horizontal and vertical split groups.
- **Commands:** Reload, address focus, history, find, and page zoom target only the selected browser tab. Reload From Origin and Stop Loading live in the Browser menu without overriding rename or cancel keys.

### Notifications

- **Entry point:** One bell in the primary toolbar. It stays in place when nothing is waiting, so the toolbar never reflows, and it carries a count only when there is one.
- **List:** A 320 pt popover, newest first, scrolling at 320 pt so a long backlog stays a popover rather than a panel.
- **Row:** One line saying what the agent did, then a caption with the workspace, the tab, and how long ago. Names are resolved from the live workspace, so renaming a tab renames the row.
- **States:** A finished turn and a question use different glyphs as well as different colors, so the two never read alike.
- **Reading:** Clicking a row goes to its tab, which is also what clears it. A Clear All in the header empties the list without visiting anything.
- **Empty:** Say plainly that nothing is waiting. Do not hide the control.

### Settings

- **Scene:** A native macOS Settings window, separate from the workspace window.
- **Browser data:** One picker with four plain-language choices, ordered from widest to narrowest: Across all workspaces, Per MyTerm folder, Per workspace, and Per project directory. "Folder" always means a sidebar folder and "directory" always means a path on disk, so the two never read as the same thing.
- **Expectation:** Say that the choice affects new browser panes and that existing panes keep their current profile.
- **Agents:** One section covers agent hooks and agent recovery together, because the hooks are what make recovery possible. Name the file each button writes, say that only MyTerm's own hooks are added or removed, say that restoring rejoins the pane's last conversation with the agent's own resume command, and say that naming a tab after a conversation takes the name the agent writes and gives way to a name the user typed.
- **Passkeys:** Show whether the signed build has Apple's managed browser entitlement and browser access. Request access from a clear button, never on launch. State that MyTerm passes requests to macOS, does not store passkeys, and leaves the choice of credential provider to the user.

### App Icon

- **Shape:** A standalone macOS icon, not a copy of another terminal's mark.
- **Motif:** A terminal prompt combined with a branching signal that hints at projects, panes, and Xylem.
- **Palette:** Xylem slate neutrals with the cyan and teal accents. Keep enough contrast to read at Dock and Spotlight sizes.
- **Rule:** No product name, letters, traffic-light controls, or borrowed terminal-brand shapes inside the icon.

### Browser engine boundary

- **Built in:** WebKit is the only engine in the main app and remains the default.
- **Boundary:** The app asks a browser-session factory to create a session for a named data profile.
- **Later:** Chromium is a separate signed and notarized download with its own helper processes, not payload carried by every MyTerm install.
- **Security:** Keep library validation enabled and require the engine package to be signed by the same developer team as the host app.

### Commands

- **Visible path:** Toolbar, contextual menu, or local action button for every frequent task.
- **Keyboard path:** Native menu commands for workspace creation, terminal and browser tabs, splits, close, sidebar visibility, and the notifications backlog.
- **Contextual zoom:** Command-Minus and Command-Equals change browser page zoom when a browser is selected, or the active workspace's terminal font size when a terminal is selected. Command-0 resets browser page zoom.

### Persistence and Recovery

- **Hierarchy:** Persist workspaces as a split layout of pane groups, with each group owning its tabs and selected tab.
- **Split state:** Persist dragged divider proportions and restore them with the workspace.
- **Migration:** Before the first v2 write, atomically preserve the exact v1 file at a deterministic adjacent backup path.
- **Lossy recovery:** If malformed array elements must be discarded, preserve the original bytes in a separate adjacent recovery backup before committing repaired state.
- **Identity:** Keep already-unique workspace, group, tab, pane, split, terminal-session, and browser-session identifiers stable across migration and repair.
- **Agent tab names:** Name a tab after the agent conversation running in its pane, taken from the terminal title the agent already writes. Take a title only while an agent has reported itself in the pane, so a shell's title is never mistaken for a conversation name, and never over a title the user typed. Keep only a plain short name out of what arrives: the title is terminal bytes, which any program in the pane can write.
- **Agent notifications:** Keep the backlog of waiting agents in memory only, and derive the tab dot from the same entries so the two surfaces cannot disagree. Reaching the tab reads the entry, one tab holds one entry, and a question outranks a finished turn.
- **Agent sessions:** Persist the agent conversation a terminal pane was in, and re-enter it on the next launch with that agent's own resume command. Save only what an agent hook reports, keep the identifier out of the interface, and drop it when the pane is left at a shell prompt. Restore an agent only when its reported identifier is one its resume command accepts: a pane that opens on a resume error is worse than a pane that opens on a prompt.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** keep workspaces scannable by title alone.
- **Do** use native macOS controls, semantic appearance, focus, menus, accessibility, and splitters.
- **Do** keep the tab row compact at 26 pt and scroll it when tabs exceed the available width.
- **Do** preserve a large, uninterrupted content surface.
- **Do** provide both a visible route and a keyboard route for frequent actions.
- **Do** make visible focus and VoiceOver labels part of the component contract.

### Don't:

- **Don't** copy cmux's notifications, agent status, per-workspace status metadata, or other features outside the requested workflow. Restoring an agent session is persistence, not a status layer: it belongs in the pane's saved state and in Settings, never in workspace chrome.
- **Don't** use decorative terminal chrome, novelty controls, or motion that interrupts focused work.
- **Don't** build terminal rendering on web technology when a native implementation is available.
- **Don't** turn workspaces, tabs, or terminal panes into floating cards.
- **Don't** use custom fixed colors where macOS already provides an adaptive semantic role.
- **Don't** let browser controls or navigation chrome compete with the active terminal or page.
